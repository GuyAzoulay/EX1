# EX1
In this project we are giving (hopfully) the best solution for an offline algorithm,
in this project we had to deal with a new language and a little bit different problem   
in according to the first task. 
The algorithm has been implemented in python 3 using 3 main classes: Elevator, Elevators
and Calls classes.

# Our task's goal
The main goal of our task was to minimize the total waiting time in a givven list of calls
and building.
